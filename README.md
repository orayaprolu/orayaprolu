# 👋 Hey, I'm Ojas

🎓 **CS & Linguistics @ UIUC** (Graduating Dec 2025)  
💻 **Backend SWE Intern @ Expedia (Summer 2025)** | Prev @ Summit Interconnect  
⚡ Passionate about **Python, backend engineering, and algorithmic trading**

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a developer who enjoys building **scalable backend systems** and **algorithmic trading infrastructure**.  
My experience ranges from **production-grade backend services** in Python and Java/Spring Boot  
to designing bots for **market making, arbitrage, and liquidity provision** across crypto & prediction markets.

What I’m excited about:
- ⚙️ High-performance backend engineering  
- 🐍 Leveraging **Python** for data-heavy and low-latency systems  
- 📈 Designing trading strategies & real-time order book systems  
- ☁️ Cloud-native deployments & modern dev practices  

I aim to merge **quantitative development** with strong **software engineering foundations**,  
and I’m especially interested in roles that bring together **backend infra + trading systems**.
