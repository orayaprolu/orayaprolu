## 🚀 About Me

I’m a developer who loves building **scalable backend systems** and **trading infrastructure**.  
My work spans from **production-grade backend services** in Java/Spring Boot and Python/FastAPI  
to **low-latency algorithmic trading bots** that operate across crypto and prediction markets.

- 🐍 Strong in **Python** (asyncio, concurrency, FastAPI, NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch)  
- ☕ Solid **Java** experience with Spring Boot  
- ☁️ Cloud-native: AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Spinnaker)  
- 📈 I design bots for **cross-exchange arbitrage, liquidity provision, and real-time order book streaming**

## 📊 Projects

### 🟢 Event Derivative Market Making Bot (Python)
- Quoted bids/asks around fair price on a prediction market  
- Derived implied probabilities from US equity options via **Black-Scholes-Merton**  
- Built an **async order manager** with Redis caching, rate-limiting, and 24/7 stability  
- Deployed on AWS with Prometheus + Grafana monitoring [oai_citation:1‡Ojas_Rayaprolu_Resume.pdf](file-service://file-DE6jRQWtFoRMSxtGBabqVp)

### 🔄 Crypto Spot Arbitrage Bot (Python)
- Captured cross-exchange inefficiencies by buying illiquid and selling liquid markets  
- Streamed **50+ pairs concurrently** with Kafka topics separating ingestion from signal computation  
- Persisted order books/fills in PostgreSQL, Redis caching for real-time arbitrage signals  
- Dockerized AWS EC2 deployment with Grafana dashboards for PnL & latency [oai_citation:2‡Ojas_Rayaprolu_Resume.pdf](file-service://file-DE6jRQWtFoRMSxtGBabqVp)

### ✉️ Expedia – LLM QA Agent
- Built an **LLM-powered QA agent** with Python + FastAPI to validate email template translations  
- Saved **1,000+ QA hours** by automating correctness checks  
- Integrated with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions + Spinnaker) [oai_citation:3‡Ojas_Rayaprolu_Resume.pdf](file-service://file-DE6jRQWtFoRMSxtGBabqVp)
