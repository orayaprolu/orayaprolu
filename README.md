## About Me

I’m a developer who enjoys building **scalable backend systems** and **algorithmic trading infrastructure**.  
My experience ranges from **production-grade backend services** in Python and Java/Spring Boot  
to designing bots for **market making, arbitrage, and liquidity provision** across crypto & prediction markets.

What I’m excited about:
- High-performance backend engineering  
- Leveraging **Python** for data-heavy and low-latency systems  
- Designing trading strategies & real-time order book systems  
- Cloud-native deployments & modern dev practices  

I aim to merge **quantitative development** with strong **software engineering foundations**,  
and I’m especially interested in roles that bring together **backend infra + trading systems**.

**Languages:**  
🐍 Python | ☕ Java
